| 1 | To calculate salary of an employee given his basic pay (take as input from user). Calculate gross salary of employee. Let HRA be 10 % of basic pay and TA be 5% of basic pay. Let employee pay professional tax as 2% of total salary. Calculate net salary payable after deductions. | Q01.py | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKuda5SDodo&list=PLlShVH4JA0osTzddxh-2s1yaigpyp6DRx&index=2&pp=iAQB |
| 2 | To accept an object mass in kilograms and velocity in meters per second and display its momentum.

| 4 | To accept student’s five courses marks and compute his/her result. Student is passing if he/she scores marks equal to and above 40 in each course.

| 23 | Guess Number: Randomly generate a number unknown to the user. The user needs to guess what that number is. If the user’s guess is wrong, the program should return some sort of indication as to how wrong (e.g. the number is too high or too low). If the user guesses correctly, a positive indication should appear. Write functions to check if the user input is an actual number, to see the difference between the inputted number and the randomly generated numbers, and to then compare the numbers. | Q23.py | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqPbirLgg2U&list=PLlShVH4JA0osTzddxh-2s1yaigpyp6DRx&index=22&pp=iAQB |
